         * Builder Design pattern is all about providing flexibility in Object Creation. The intent of the builder
         * design pattern is to isolate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
         *
         * With builder pattern we also insure the immutability of the object after it's creation
         *
         * Ex of builder in JDK are:
         * java.lang.StringBuilder
         * java.lang.StringBuffer
         *
         *StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
         * sb.append("Test"); - append() method returns the instance of itself, after adding values to it
