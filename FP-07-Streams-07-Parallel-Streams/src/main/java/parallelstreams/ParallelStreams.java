         * Main idea of using parallel streams is to improve the performance
         *
         * There are 2 ways of processing with streams:
         * Sequential - <collection>.stream() - streams are always sequential by default
         * Parallel - to create a parallel Stream:
         *                                          - <collection>.parallelStream() method or
         *                                          - <stream>.parallel() - invoke a parallel() method on a regular sequential stream
